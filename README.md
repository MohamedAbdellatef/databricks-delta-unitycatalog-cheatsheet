# Databricks / Delta Lake / Unity Catalog – Interview Cheat Sheet

This repo contains my personal interview notes and cheat sheet for:

* Databricks basics (clusters, notebooks, jobs, DBFS, Spark configs & monitoring)
* Delta Lake (ACID, MERGE/UPDATE/DELETE, time travel, Bronze/Silver/Gold)
* Unity Catalog (catalog.schema.table, permissions, governance & lineage)

👉 Full cheat sheet is in: [`databricks-delta-uc-cheatsheet.md`](databricks-delta-uc-cheatsheet.md)
